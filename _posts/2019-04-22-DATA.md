The dataset is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time. 


The dataset is anonymized and contains **a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.**
For each user, Instacart provides between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. 
We also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.
