The dataset is provided as-is for non-commercial use, and can be downloaded from S3 at: https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 

The dataset is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, we provide between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. We also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.
