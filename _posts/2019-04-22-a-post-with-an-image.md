<strong>Why this topic?</strong>
I first time found out Instacart from my apartment website and got my grocery delivered in 2 hours on the same day. I was impressed by its efficiency and time-saving. Later, I read an article on Medium website about Instacart released their first public dataset contains a sample of 3 million grocery orders. They asked machine learning community to use this data to test models for predicting products that a user will buy again, try for the first time or add to cart next during a session. I’m really interested in the data itself and wish to use what I learned to assist what I used in my daily life.

<strong>Why it is important?</strong>
The motivation behind it quite simple: As a grocery delivering company, you would want to optimize your supply chains, minimize waste, and avoid backorders. Although humans do not follow a well-defined logic, we do have some repeated patterns. We often buy the same things, behave in a similar way and follow similar intuitions. So, if we can learn the buyer’s pattern, we may be able to identify the next buyer too!
