One of the most challenging part of the project is elaboratively researching all possible and influential features, since feature engineering is essential for improving model performance and accuracy. Feature creation helps to unleash hidden relationship of a data set, and feature selection finds out the best subset of attributes which better explains the relation of independent variables with target variable. 

Additionally, having more data is always the primary way to improve accuracy. The distinct users of the data are not enough when compared the total users. The dataset only contains one-year data, it's better to include more years. The dataset contains around 60% reorder users, improve the number of reorder users will provide more valuable results.

Then, always trying multiple algorithms to achieve better performance. Neural Networks is always a great way that use for feature extraction, and Catboost is another gradient boost like XGBoost which is fast, scalable and high-performance. Different algorithms and approach help to motivate other interesting findings
